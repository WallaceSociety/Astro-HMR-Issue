## Fix the Root Cause of Your Acne

If you have hormonal acne and are following a skincare routine, but **_still get breakouts,_** then it could be that you need to **_address the root cause_** of your acne…

Skincare products are kind of like Band-aids leaving the real source of your acne unfixed.

Research [shows](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352647515000155) that **_acne skincare products might actually be causing irritation, dryness, flare ups of rosacea, and atopic dermatitis…_**

**_Changing your diet needs to be your next move._**

Foods we eat everyday as part of our western diet are causing spikes in blood sugar levels, which leads to a rise in insulin production (to bring down your blood sugar), which leads to a rise in androgen hormone.

High levels of **_androgen hormone_** makes sebum thick and sticky which ends up clogging pores. So, we end up with inflammation and hormonal imbalance making it harder for our acne skincare routine to do its job.

Hi, I'm Brooke, a RN and skincare junkie. I use my **_medical background_** to find the **_best solutions to the most annoying skin problems._**

Our **_7 day hormonal acne diet plan is full of plant-based, clean eating recipes_** that are backed by research and will kick your skincare routine into high gear!

## Our Philosophy for the Hormonal Acne Diet Plan

### Avoid Processed Foods

The key here is to [avoid blood sugar spikes](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4884775/)! No white sugar, white flour, or processed foods. This includes sweets and sugary drinks like soda, juice, and alcohol. \_We have suggestions for satisfying alternatives!

### Avoid Milk and Limit Dairy

Drinking milk has been shown to promote insulin secretion and a [hormone called IGF-1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6115795/), which has been linked with acne development. Whey protein, a milk derived protein, has also been [linked to acne](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3900340/). Cheese and yogurt is less proven to cause acne, so _for 7 days you'll eliminate then add it back slowly._

### Eat Nutrient-Dense Foods

You want the most bang for your buck! Nutrient-dense foods have whole grains, healthy fats, and color.

### Vitamins

Vitamins help regulate sebum production, heal and protect skin cells, and boost collagen. Vitamins C and A are especially important. Foods like carrots, broccoli, sweet potatoes, and citrus fruits are a great source of acne-fighting vitamins.

### Omega-3

Getting good fats like omega-3's will help reduce inflammation. You'll get it from flax and chia seeds, walnuts, and salmon. Plus, You'll avoid not-so-good fats like omega-6.

### Zinc

Keeping your microbiome healthy will make sure p. Acne bacteria is under control. Plant-based sources include legumes, seeds, nuts, potatoes, eggs, and dark chocolate will help. If you go for the chocolate, just be sure it's not loaded with sugar!

### Antioxidants

Fights free radicals in the air touching our skin and also in our bodies. You'll be “eating the rainbow,” which means filling your meals with colorful foods and drinking green tea.

### Probiotics

Reduce inflammation and increase the absorption of nutrients. Great sources are miso, pickles, kim chi, and sauerkraut.

### Meat

Meat [causes](https://www.pnas.org/doi/abs/10.1073/pnas.1417508112) inflammation. And if the animal was producing stress hormones at the time it was slaughtered, you'll end up eating those hormones in your body. Our 7 Day Hormonal Acne Diet is **plant-based**. As your skin clears up, you can introduce meat back in, if you wish, and decide if your skin tolerates it well.

Instead of only giving you a list of foods to eat or not to eat…
